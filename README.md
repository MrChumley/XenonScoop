# XenonScoop
Xenon Atmospheric Scoop for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5  By MrChumley

Installation: Place the XenonScoop folder inside your KSP/Gamedata folder.

Please note:  This is essentially just a ModuleManager .cfg. It reuses meshes and textures from the existing radial intake. Includes a new resource (Atmo) to let it use non-oxygenated atmospheres too.

REQUIRES ModuleManager to work.  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533
